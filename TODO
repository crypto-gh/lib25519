track history more precisely in documentation for individual source files
consider symlinks from files in build tree to source tree (via a build/source symlink so build can link elsewhere)
allow shared-* for API functions (requires tweaking dispatch)
speedups for more architectures
speedups for more microarchitectures
consider faster PRF for the keyed hash giving the nonce
merge subroutines in source to the extent possible
scan for and remove any unused functions and files
restructure for more merging at object-code level
sort object files (for, e.g., improved cache utilization)
optionally allow post-installation patching of current cpu as an exceptional cpuid
  (based on benchmarks and, with more CPU time, full functionality tests)
dispatch: eliminate, e.g., avx2 if avx is higher priority
speed up dispatch cpuid tests (lazy evaluation, merging cpuid calls)
randombytes: support getrandom, getentropy
verify constbranch, constindex
full functional verification
